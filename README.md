# Mid-term Project
This is a project done in Frontend Ironhack Bootcamp.
The project is a duplicate of [Circle Agency](https://circle-agency-35d27e.webflow.io/).

Consisted in cloning some pages of the mentioned website: the [home](https://circle-agency-35d27e.webflow.io/) page, the [contact](https://circle-agency-35d27e.webflow.io/contact-us/) page and the [project](https://circle-agency-35d27e.webflow.io/projects/simplify) page.
The page had to be responsive for mobile and desktop and we had to import the projects information from a JSON.
